    <h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">This class is about more than computer programming!</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Indeed, this class is about problem-solving in a way that is exceedingly empowering! You will
        likely take the problem solving that you learn here will likely be instantly applicable to your work beyond this
        course and even your career as a whole!</li>
      <li data-marker="*">However, it will not be easy! You will be “drinking from the firehose” of knowledge during
        this course. You’ll be amazed at what you will be able to accomplish in the coming weeks.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">This course is far more about you advancing “you” from “where you are today” than hitting some
        imagined standard.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">The most important opening consideration in this course: Give the time you need to learn
        through this course. Everyone learns differently. If something does not work out well at the start, know that
        with time you will grow and grow in your skill.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="whats-ahead">What’s Ahead</h2>
    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">You will be learning this week about Scratch, a visual programming language.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Then, in future weeks, you will learn about C. That will look something like this:</p>

        <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"hello, world</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Further, as the weeks progress, you will learn about algorithms.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">You will learn about memory.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">You will learn about buggy code and what causes computer crashes.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">You will learn about data structures such as a hash table.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Then, we will transition to a new, higher-level language called <em>Python</em>. Your code will look
          something like this:</p>

        <div class="language-py highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"hello, world"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">This class will give you a strong understanding of how recent programming languages developed
        from the earlier ones.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">We will also be looking at how we can use databases and third-party frameworks to build web
        applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="community">Community!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">You are part of a community of those taking this course at Harvard College, Harvard Extension
        School, and via edX.org.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Puzzle Day and the CS50 Fair</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="computational-thinking">Computational Thinking</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Essentially, computer programming is about taking some input and creating some output - thus solving a
          problem. What happens in between the input and output, what we could call <em>a black box,</em> is the focus
          of this course.</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Slide38.png" alt="Black box with input and output"
            title="Black box with input and output"></p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">For example, we may need to take attendance for a class. We could use a system called
        <em>unary</em> to count, one finger at a time. Computers today count using a system called <em>binary</em>. It’s
        from the term <em>binary digit</em> that we get a familiar term called <em>bit</em>. A <em>bit</em> is a zero or
        one.
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Computers only speak in terms of zeros and ones. Zeros represent <em>off.</em> Ones represent
        <em>on.</em> Computers are millions, and perhaps billions, of transistors that are being turned on and off.
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">If you imagine using a light bulb, a single bulb can only count from zero to one.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">However, if you were to have three light bulbs, there are more options open to you!</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Using three light bulbs, the following could represent zero:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  0 0 0
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Similarly, the following would represent one:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  0 0 1
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>By this logic, we could propose that the following equals two:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  0 1 0
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Extending this logic further, the following represents three:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  0 1 1
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Four would appear as:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  1 0 0
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>We could, in fact, using only three light bulbs count as high as seven!</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  1 1 1
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>As a heuristic, we could imagine that the following values represent each possible place in our <em>binary
            digit</em>:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  4 2 1
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Computers use ‘base-2’ to count. This can be pictured as follows:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  2^2  2^1  2^0
  4    2    1
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Therefore, you could say that it would require three bits (the four’s place, the two’s place, and the one’s
          place) to represent a number as high as seven.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Computers generally use eight bits to represent a number. For example, <code
          class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00000101</code> is the number 5 in <em>binary</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="text">Text</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">Just as numbers are binary patterns of ones and zeros, letters are represented using ones and
        zeros too!</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Since there is an overlap between the ones and zeros that represent numbers and letters, the
        <em>ASCII</em> standard was created to map specific letters to specific numbers.
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">For example, the letter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> was
        decided to map to the number 65.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>If you received a text message, the binary under that message might represent the numbers 72, 73, and 33.
          Mapping these out to ASCII, your message would look as follows:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  H   I   !
  72  73  33
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Thank goodness for standards like ASCII that allow us to agree upon these values!</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Here is an expanded map of ASCII values:</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Slide93.png" alt="ASCII map" title="ASCII map"></p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="emojis">Emojis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">As time has rolled on, there are more and more ways to communicate via text.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Since there were not enough digits in binary to represent all the various characters that
        could be represented by humans, the <em>Unicode</em> standard expanded the number of bits that can be
        transmitted and understood by computers.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>There are emojis that you probably use every day. The following may look familiar to you:</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Slide103.png" alt="emojis" title="emojis"></p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Computer scientists faced a challenge when wanting to assign various skin tones to each emoji
        to allow the communication to be further personalized. In this case, the creators and contributors of emojis
        decided that the initial bits would be the structure of the emoji itself, followed by skin tone.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">More and more features are being added to the Unicode standard to represent further characters
        and emojis.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">If you wish, you can learn more about <a

        <p>Taking our previously used 72, 73, and 33, which said <code

          light shade of yellow. The red value would be 72, the green value would be 73, and the blue would be 33.</p>

      <li data-marker="*">Music can be represented through MIDI data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">Problem-solving is central to computer science and computer programming.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Imagine the basic problem of trying to locate a single name in a phone book.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">How might you go about this?</li>
      <li data-marker="*">One approach could be to simply read from page one to the next to the next until reaching the
        last page.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Another approach could be to search two pages at a time.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">A final and perhaps better approach could be to go to the middle of the phone book and ask,
        “Is the name I am looking for to the left or to the right?” Then, repeat this process, cutting the problem in
        half and half and half.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Each of these approaches could be called algorithms. The speed of each of these algorithms can be pictured as
          follows in what is called <em>big-O notation</em>:</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Slide141.png" alt="big o notation" title="big o notation">
          Notice that the first algorithm, highlighted in red, has a big-O of <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> because if there are 100 names in the phone book, it
          could take up to 100 tries to find the correct name. The second algorithm, where two pages were searched at a
          time, has a big-O of ‘n/2’ because we searched twice as fast through the pages. The final algorithm has a
          big-O of log<sub>2</sub>n as doubling the problem would only result in one more step to solve the problem.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="pseudocode-and-the-basic-building-blocks-of-programming">Pseudocode and the Basic Building Blocks of
      Programming</h2>
    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">The ability to create <em>pseudocode</em> is central to one’s success in both this class and
        in computer programming.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Pseudocode is a human-readable version of your code. For example, considering the third algorithm above, we
          could compose pseudocode as follows:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>  1  Pick up phone book
  2  Open to middle of phone book
  3  Look at page
  4  If person is on page
  5      Call person
  6  Else if person is earlier in book
  7      Open to middle of left half of book
  8      Go back to line 3
  9  Else if person is later in book
  10     Open to middle of right half of book
  11     Go back to line 3
  12 Else
  13     Quit
</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Pseudocoding is such an important skill for at least two reasons. First, when you pseudocode
        before you create formal code, it allows you to think through the logic of your problem in advance. Second, when
        you pseudocode, you can later provide this information to others that are seeking to understand your coding
        decisions and how your code works.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Notice that the language within our pseudocode has some unique features. First, some of these
        lines begin with verbs like <em>pick up,</em> <em>open,</em> <em>look at.</em> Later, we will call these
        <em>functions</em>.
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Second, notice that some lines include statements like <code
          class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> or <code
          class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else if.</code> These are called <em>conditionals</em>.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Third, notice how there are expressions that can be stated as <em>true</em> or <em>false,</em>
        such as “person is earlier in the book.” We call these <em>boolean expressions</em>.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Finally, notice how these statements like “go back to line 3.” We call these <em>loops</em>.
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">In the context of <em>Scratch</em>, which is discussed below, we will use each of the above
        basic building blocks of programming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="scratch">Scratch</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*"><em>Scratch</em> is a visual programming language developed by MIT.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Scratch utilizes the same essential coding building blocks that we covered earlier in this
        lecture.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Scatch is a great way to get into computer programming because it allows you to play with
        these building blocks in a visual manner, not having to be concerned about the syntax of curly braces,
        semicolons, parentheses, and the like.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Scatch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDE</code> (integrated development environment)

          Notice that on the left, there are <em>building blocks</em> that you can use in your programming. To the
          immediate right of the building blocks, there is the area to which you can drag blocks to build a program. To
          the right of that, you see the <em>stage</em> where a cat stands. The stage is where your programming comes to
          life.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Scratch operates on a coordinate system as follows:</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Slide167.png" alt="scratch coordinate system" title="scratch coordinate system">
          Notice that the center of the stage is at coordinate (0,0). Right now, the cat’s position is at that same
          position.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>To begin, drag the “when green flag clicked” building block to the programming area. Then, drag the <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">say</code> building block to the programming area and attach it
          to the previous block.</p>
          <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch01.png" alt="scratch 01" title="scratch 01"></p>

        <!-- <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  say [hello, world]
</code></pre> -->
        <p>Notice that when you click the green flag now, on the stage, the cat says, “hello world.”</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>This illustrates quite well what we were discussing earlier regarding programming:</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Slide172.png" alt="scratch with black box" title="scratch with black box">
          Notice that the input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello world</code> is passed to the
          function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">say</code>, and the <em>side effect</em> of that
          function running is the cat saying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello world</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>We can make your program more interactive by having the cat say <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code> to someone specific. Modify your program as below:
        </p>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch02.png" alt="scratch 02" title="scratch 02"></p>

        <!-- <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  ask [What's your name?] and wait
  say (join [hello,] (answer))
</code></pre> -->
        <p>Notice that when the green flag is clicked, the function <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ask</code> is run. The program prompts you, the user, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What's your name?</code> It then stores that name in the
          <em>variable</em> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">answer</code>. The program then
          passes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">answer</code> to a special function called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">join</code>, which combines two strings of text <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code>, and whatever name was provided. These
          collectively are passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">say</code> function. The cat
          says, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello,</code> and a name. Your program is now
          interactive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Quite similarly, we can modify our program as follows:</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch03.png" alt="scratch 03" title="scratch 03"></p>

        <!-- <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  ask [What's your name?] and wait
  speak (join [hello,] (answer))
</code></pre> -->
        <p>Notice that this program, when the green flag is clicked, passes the same variable, joined with <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello</code>, to a function called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speak</code>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">Along with pseudocoding, <em>abstraction</em> is an essential skill and concept within
        computer programming.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Abstraction is the act of simplifying a problem into smaller and smaller problems.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">For example, if you were hosting a huge dinner for your friends, the <em>problem</em> of
        having to cook the entire meal could be quite overwhelming! However, if you break down the task of cooking the
        meal into smaller and smaller tasks (or problems), the big task of creating this delicious meal might feel less
        challenging.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>In programming, and even within Scratch, we can see abstraction in action. In your programming area, program
          as follows:</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch04.png" alt="scratch 04" title="scratch 04"></p>

        <!-- <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  play sound (Meow v) until done
  wait (1) seconds
  play sound (Meow v) until done
  wait (1) seconds
  play sound (Meow v) until done
</code></pre> -->
        <p>Notice that you are doing the same thing over and over again. Indeed, if you see yourself repeatedly coding
          the same statements, it’s likely the case that you could program more artfully – abstracting away this
          repetitive code.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>You can modify your code as follows:</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch05.png" alt="scratch 05" title="scratch 05"></p>

        <!-- <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  repeat (3)
  play sound (Meow v) until done
  wait (1) seconds
</code></pre> -->
        <p>Notice that the loop does exactly as the previous program did. However, the problem is simplified by
          abstracting away the repetition to a block that <em>repeats</em> the code for us.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>We can even advance this further by using the <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define</code> block, where you can create your own block (your
          own function)! Write code as follows:</p>

        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch06.png" alt="scratch define" title="scratch define"></p>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch07.png" alt="scratch define 2" title="scratch define 2"></p>
          
        <p>Notice that we are defining our own block called <code
          class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meow</code>. The function plays the sound <code
          class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meow</code>, then waits one second. Below that, you can see
        that when the green flag is clicked, our meow function is repeated three times.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>We can even provide a way by which the function can take an input <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> and repeat a number of times:</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch08.png" alt="scratch 08" title="scratch 08"></p>
        <p><img src="./assets/images/cs50Week0Scratch09.png" alt="scratch 09" title="scratch 09"></p>

        <!-- <pre><code class="language-scratch">  define meow
  play sound (Meow v) until done
  wait (1) seconds

  when green flag clicked
  repeat (3)
  meow
</code></pre> -->
        <p>Notice how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> is taken from “meow n times.” <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> is passed to the meow function through the <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define</code> block.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">The cat, by the way, we can call a <code
          class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sprite</code> – a general term used in game programming for an
        object or character on the screen with which the player will interact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="if">If</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*"><em>conditionals</em> are an essential building block of programming, where the program looks
        to see if a specific condition has been met. If a condition is met, the program does something.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>To illustrate a conditional, write code as follows:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  forever
  if &lt;touching (mouse-pointer v)?&gt; then
  play sound (Meow v) until done
</code></pre>
        <p>Notice that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forever</code> block is utilized such that
          the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> block is triggered over and over again, such
          that it can check continuously if the cat is touching the mouse pointer.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>We can modify our program as follows to integrate video sensing:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when video motion &gt; (50)
  play sound (Meow v) until done
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">Remember, programming is often a process of trial and error. If you get frustrated, take time
        to talk yourself through the problem at hand. What is the specific problem that you are working on right now?
        What is working? What is not working?</li>

    <h2 id="sprite-movement">Sprite Movement</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">Moving away from Oscartime to Ivy’s Hardest Game, we can now imagine how to implement movement
        within our program.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">Our program has three main components.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>First, write code as follows:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  go to x: (0) y: (0)
  forever
  listen for keyboard
  feel for walls
</code></pre>
        <p>Notice that when the green flag is clicked, our sprite moves to the center of the stage at coordinates (0,0)
          and then listens for the keyboard and checks for walls forever.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Second, add this second group of code blocks:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-scratch">  define listen for keyboard
  if &lt;key (up arrow v) pressed?&gt; then
  change y by (1)
  end
  if &lt;key (down arrow v) pressed?&gt; then
  change y by (-1)
  end
  if &lt;key (right arrow v) pressed?&gt; then
  change x by (1)
  end
  if &lt;key (left arrow v) pressed?&gt; then
  change x by (-1)
  end
</code></pre>
        <p>Notice how we have created a custom <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listen for keyboard</code> script. For each of our arrow keys
          on the keyboard, it will move the sprite around the screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Finally, add this group of code blocks:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-scratch">  define feel for walls
  if &lt;touching (left wall v) ?&gt; then
  change x by (1)
  end
  if &lt;touching (right wall v) ?&gt; then
  change x by (-1)
  end
</code></pre>
        <p>Notice how we also have a custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feel for walls</code>
          script. When a sprite touches a wall, it moves it back to a safe position – preventing it from walking off the
          screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">You can learn more by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/565121265">exploring these

      <li data-marker="*">Go try the full game <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196">Oscartime</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="more-sprites">More Sprites</h2>

    <ul>
      <li data-marker="*">Scratch allows for many sprites to be on the screen at once.</li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>Adding another sprite, add the following code blocks to your program:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  go to x: (0) y: (0)
  point in direction (90)
  forever
  if &lt;&lt;touching (left wall v)?&gt; or &lt;touching (right wall v)?&gt;&gt; then
  turn right (180) degrees
  end
  move (1) steps
  end
</code></pre>
        <p>Notice how the Yale sprite seems to get in the way of the Harvard sprite by moving back and forth. When it
          bumps into a wall, it turns around until it bumps the wall again. You can learn more by <a
            href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/565127193">exploring these code blocks</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-marker="*">
        <p>You can even make a sprite follow another sprite. Adding another sprite, add the following code blocks to
          your program:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-scratch">  when green flag clicked
  go to (random position v)
